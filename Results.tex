\section{Qubit state transfers}
\subsection{%
	\texorpdfstring{\boldmath{\(\ket{0}\rightarrow\ket{1}\)}}{0 -> 1} state transfer
}
In \cref{fig:3d-optim-ge} the fidelity during all optimization runs are plotted.
For pulse lengths longer than \SI{15}{\nano\second} the fidelity starts at values close to the goal (\(F>0.9\)) and the number of iterations is relatively low (less than 85 iterations).
In contrast, pulses shorter than \SI{15}{\nano\second} start at lower fidelities while the number of iterations are roughly one order of magnitude larger with no clear pattern with respect to the pulse length.

To give a more detailed picture, the starting fidelity and optimized fidelity is plotted over pulse length in \cref{fig:fidelity-length-ge}.
The optimizations where the fidelity goal was not reached, pulse lengths equal to and below \SI{10.50}{\nano\second}, are marked with stars.

Further analysis is done on pulses with lengths \SI{4.25}{\nano\second}, \SI{6.0}{\nano\second}, \SI{8.0}{\nano\second}, \SI{10.0}{\nano\second}, \SI{20.0}{\nano\second} and \SI{30.0}{\nano\second}.
The optimized pulse shapes \(\text{Re}(\Omega)\) and \(\text{Im}(\Omega)\) are plotted in \cref{fig:pulse_shape} together with the guess pulses. Pulses longer than \ns{20} require only fine adjustments to the Blackman guess pulse while shorter pulses have an imaginary part which is maximized for the whole duration of the pulse.

The spectrum of \(\Omega(t)\) in the lab frame (\(\Omega(t)\ex^{i\omega_q t}\)) is shown in \cref{fig:pulse_spectrum}.
For all pulse lengths there is a peak centered roughly at \(\omega_q\) with a quickly decaying end in positive direction (towards \(\omega_q+\kappa_q\)).
Following the trend, it can be observed that the width of the peak becomes narrower for longer pulses.
For the highest pulse length \ns{30} there is almost no support at \(\omega_{q}+\kappa_q\) nor \(\omega_{q}-\kappa_q\).

and the projection of the state on the Bloch sphere over time, \cref{fig:bloch_evolution}.

For short pulse lengths there is not enough time for the transfer from \(\ket{0}\) to \(\ket{1}\),
but for a pulse length of roughly \ns{10.0} the goal is reached.
\Cref{fig:qubit_occupation} \textbf{(b)} shows a little rise in occupation of \(\ket{2}\) around \ns{7.5}.

\caption{Time dynamics on the Bloch sphere for different lengths of optimized pulses.}\label{fig:bloch_evolution}

From the Bloch sphere visualization it appears that shorter pulse lengths lead to deviations from the pure y-axis rotation.
This can be clearly seen in \cref{fig:bloch_evolution} \textbf{(d)} for a pulse length of \ns{10}, where the fidelity goal was reached but short enough that the maximum amplitude is reached for the guess pulse.

Once again all optimization runs are shown in \cref{fig:3d-optim-gf}.
All runs start at almost zero fidelity while pulse lengths from \ns{30} and up reach the fidelity goal of \(F > 0.99999\).
The number of iterations are relatively low down to \ns{30} and for shorter pulses the iterations fluctuate.
Note that for pulse lengths shorter than \ns{22} the optimization stopped after the first iteration due to \(\Delta F < \num{e-09}\).

\end{figure}

In \cref{fig:fidelity-length-gf} the fidelity is shown with respect to pulse length and here it is seen that the fidelity goal is reached for pulses down to \ns{30}.

The optimized pulses are shown in \cref{fig:pulse_shape_gf}.
For all pulse lengths the pulses have roughly the same shape with a quick rise and a short plateau, then oscillations until the end. 
The longest pulse at \ns{55} has more oscillations than, but instead they are lower in amplitude.
To get some insight, the frequency spectrum, \cref{fig:pulse_spectrum_gf}, shows large support at \(\omega_q\) and \(\omega_q+\kappa_q\), while for longer pulses a peak at \(\omega_q-\kappa_q\) disappears.
Just as the previous state transfer, the peaks narrow for longer pulse lengths.

The occupation dynamics in \cref{fig:qubit_occupation_gf} show a slow oscillation in all pulse lengths for all states.
Further, the occupation probability of \(\ket{1}\) rises to about 0.75 until the middle-point of the pulse and then falls to zero in the end, while \(\ket{2}\) starts to rise at the point of the population inversion.
For the shorter pulse lengths it can be seen that there isn't enough time to realise the transfer.

\section{Cat code encoding}
The cat encoding optimization reached the convergence criteria of \(\Delta F < \num{e-6}\) after 2389 iterations (totalling at roughly 41 hours and 28 minutes) with a fidelity \(F = 0.999380\), recall the fidelity measure in \cref{eq:total-fidelity}.
The individual fidelities for the 6 initial states are shown in \cref{tab:cat-fidelities}, where we can see that all individual fidelities are above 0.999000.

The pulse shapes of the qubit and resonator are shown in \cref{fig:cat-pulse-shape}.
Comparing the resonator and qubit we can see that the resonator pulse has rapid oscillations throughout the whole pulse while the qubit exhibits some small quick oscillation at sparse times.
The spectrum of the pulse is shown in \cref{cat-pulse-spectrum} and gives us some insight into the pulse shapes.
The qubit control pulse shows a wide peak at \(\omega_q\), two small peaks at \(\omega_r\) and \(2\omega_r-\omega_q\) and two barely noticable peaks at \(\frac{1}{4}\omega_r\) and \(\frac{1}{2}\omega_r\). 
The resonator pulse has one wide peak at \(\omega_r\), a smaller one at \(\omega_q\) and an even smaller peak at \(2\omega_r-\omega_q\).

The dynamics of the qubit is shown in \cref{fig:cat-qubit-occupation} for all state transfers.
Here we see that there is always a rapid oscillation present in the occupation probability.
Looking at the dynamical behaviour one can see that common for all transfers is for the qubit to stay somewhat close to an equal superposition between \(\ket{0}\) and \(\ket{1}\) and then at circa \ns{50} evolve to \(\ket{0}\).

\end{figure}

The dynamics of the resonator are shown in \cref{app:resonator-occupation} as there are too many states for one plot, however one interesting measure we can look at is the maximum occupation of the 8 resonator states.
This can give us information about the the validity of the Hilbert space truncation.
In \cref{fig:cat-max-occ} the maximum reached occupation probability are plotted for all states.
This is done for all the 6 state transfers.
Looking only at the odd states there is a clear downward trend for higher states, with \(\ket{7}\) only reaching circa 0.2 of occupation probability during the \(\ket{0}\) transfer.
\(\ket{6}\) is in the 0.2–0.3 occupation range for all transfers.

\tikzfig{figs/cat_max_occ}{asda}{fig:cat-max-occ}{0.8\textwidth}{20em}

Finally we can plot the Wigner function of the final resonator states and compare it with the target states.
This is done in \cref{fig:cat-resonator-wigner} where the final states have been transformed back into the lab frame.
As is evident from the plots they are close to the target states shown in \cref{fig:cat-resonator-wigner-targets}.
