\chapter{Conclusion}

In conclusion, Krotov's method efficiently realises the \(\ket{0}\rightarrow\ket{1}\) transfer for various pulse lengths when supplying guess pulses close to \(\pi\)-pulses.
It can also find non-trivial solutions for shorter pulse lengths, when an amplitude constraints is present,


\section{Future work}
Dispersive regime
Penalize higher states
Include dissipation (Liouvillian)
Ensemble optimization for different phases of the coupling pulses

Perhaps one could find an optimization method that is faster at fine-tuning and combine this with Krotov's method.
